 RDPSIM: A cycle-accurate Reality Display Processor (RSP) simulator.
==============================================================================

As it stands, this is not actually cycle-accurate; it only aims to be pixel-
accurate. Since there are so many untested components in the console, and this
is one of the most (if not, most) complex, revisiting it at a later time will
aid implementation. It'll also get a working product out the door faster.
